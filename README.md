##A Brief Introduction: What is phytoremediation and why should I plant a Phyto-Garden?

Phytoremediation is a highly effective, cost-efficient, and achievable solution to many of the environmental issues faced today. And best of all, it is an option readily available to anyone with access to a garden, large or small. 

Phytoremediation refers to the ability of living plants and micro-organisms to de-contaminate the environment through bioaccumulation, whereby the absorb the toxin and lock it in place, or one or more other natural phytoremediation processes.

I first began researching the ability of living plants to purify soil, air, and water of toxic pollutants after moving from rapidly-developing Nashville, TN to a 163 year-old farmhouse in Central New York. Having just relocated to the remote, scenic Finger Lakes Region, I was surprised when our exterminator advised me to have our well water tested for bacteria and lead. 

Upon taking his advice, I was shocked at the test results. Not only was the bacteria level too high to count but there was a substantial amount of lead in our water, and research shows no amount of lead is safe.

Before seeing the test results, I had never considered the impact of the lead paint peeling off our barn with every rain, or the leaded-gasoline particles remaining from pre-1975 automobiles, perpetually being kicked back up into the air and washing into the ground water. 

Rather than panicking, I turned to plants. A passionate native plant gardener, I had already planted 400+ native plants around the property to help return the swamp-turned-farm-turned-golf course to its natural wetland state, enabling it to once again function as the natural and efficient water filtration system it is. 

While I have long been aware of the importance of native plants and promoting healthy ecosystems, the realization that I can create a targeted and strategic approach to remediating my personal environmental concerns has been incredibly empowering, further energizing my passion for gardening. 

Through the simple act of planting, anyone can harness the highly advanced, effective and sustainable technology of plants to address the environmental concerns of today, and do their part in ensuring a healthier tomorrow.
